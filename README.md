# Individual Tree Identification in Native Forest Images
The main objective of this work is to identify and differentiate individual trees in drone-captured images of native forests. The specific images for this experiment are of a green area within the UFRRJ campus.

This application is intended to make forrestry upkeep efforts less labor intensive. Today, making inventory of a forrest requires frequent visits by foot. If there was a reliable method to observe previously catalogued trees with a drone survey, it would make the job of forrest engineers much easier.

The main processing tasks involved will be image segmentation, to divide the images into individuals. Also, image description will be used to identify the segmented individuals' species.

Images are provided by Professor [Bruno Mendon√ßa](https://institutos.ufrrj.br/if/bruno-araujo-furtado-de-mendonca/) and Fernando Canto. They were obtained with support from FAPERJ and UFFRJ.
